# Safe Deployment Checklist for Multi-Branch Features

## Pre-Deployment (Local Testing)

### 1. Database Backup Strategy
- [ ] Create database backup before migration
- [ ] Test migrations on copy of production data
- [ ] Verify existing data integrity after migration

### 2. Migration Safety
- [ ] Run `python manage.py makemigrations --dry-run` to preview changes
- [ ] Test migrations locally with existing data
- [ ] Verify all existing members get assigned to default branch
- [ ] Test rollback procedure

### 3. Functionality Testing
- [ ] Verify existing member registration still works
- [ ] Test member directory access
- [ ] Confirm admin interface functionality
- [ ] Test user authentication and permissions

## Deployment Strategy

### Option A: Blue-Green Deployment (Recommended)
1. Deploy to staging environment first
2. Test all functionality with production data copy
3. Switch traffic only after verification
4. Keep old version running for quick rollback

### Option B: Rolling Deployment
1. Deploy during low-traffic hours
2. Monitor error logs in real-time
3. Have rollback script ready
4. Test critical paths immediately after deployment

## Rollback Plan

### If Issues Occur:
1. **Immediate**: Revert to previous Git commit
2. **Database**: Restore from backup if needed
3. **Verification**: Test core functionality
4. **Communication**: Notify users of temporary issues

## Post-Deployment Verification

- [ ] Test member registration
- [ ] Verify existing member data intact
- [ ] Test admin access
- [ ] Check branch assignment functionality
- [ ] Verify news system (if used)
- [ ] Test attendance tracking (if used)
